The author explains that building a houseis similar to the construction of a building because
they both describe complex things, and the consequences of poor design can result in terrible
final products. He describes the build process, “First you have to decide what kind of house
you want tobuild—analogous in software development to problem definition. Then you and
anarchitect have to come up with a general design and get it approved. This is similar to
software architectural design.” He also describes the off the shelf vs. in house code as being
custom but maybe more efficient, and goes into the penalty of failure for a large software
project is the same as a failure of a large building, resulting in many losses.
I think the biggest difference between the two is that software is constantly evolving
whereas a building is planned and then executed on. When working on software however,
the requirements from stakeholders are forever changing and software must be able to adapt to
those newchanges without high levels of effort to be successful.
