Design is extremely important to construction. I think that at the end of the day
design and architecture are the most important part of software development, as it
lays the foundation on which all your code is written upon. If there was a bad
architectural decision made early in the software development process, you may not
know about the consequences until much later in development, when it is too late
to make to correct modifications without significant rework. I think that design
and architecture decisions should be thought upon carefully as the decisions that
are made might make or break the maintenance effort and therefore drive the success
of the project.
